    <p><b>BANDARBAN</b>
        <br> 
        Bandarban is a mysterious place. Where the beauty is endless. Where you can drown with the environment.
        A place where we once go and never forget. This was the first time I went to Bandarban.Bandarban lies, by bus, eight hours away from Dhaka, two hours from Chittagong and three hours from Cox's Bazar. It is also possible to get there by a six-hour bus ride from Rangamati. The Buddha Dhatu Jadi, the Buddhist temple in Bangladesh, located in Balaghata, 4 km from the town. This place attracts many tourists every year. This Theravada Buddhist temple is made completely in the style of South-East Asia and houses the second largest statue of the Buddha in Bangladesh. The waterfall named Shoilo Propat at Milanchari is another place tourists like to visit. The numerous Buddhist temples, known as kyang in local tongue, and bhihars in the town include the highly notable the Rajvihar (royal vihar) at Jadipara and the Ujanipara Bhihar. Bawm villages around Chimbuk, and Mru villages a little further off, are also lie within a day's journey from the town. Prantik Lake, Jibannagar and Kyachlong Lake are some more places of interest. Boat ride on the river Shangu is one of the main attractions here for tourists.

    <p>At first me and my friends decided to go Bandarban for a Trekking Tour. We Bought the train ticket from Dhaka Railway station for Chittagong and started our journey at night. Everything was going good and we arrived at the destination.
        We had our breakfast and its almost morning. We bought ticket and went for Bandarban from Chittagong. It was almost 2 to 3 hrs journey to the destination. After going their we went to Thanchi and stayed their for a day.
        We were preparing ourself for trekking. We went to many places from then on. And we returned from their after 4 days of tour by bus.
        It was a great journey. The environment of Bandarban was so clear and clean. People their were so friendly. We loved touring the outmost places of Bandarban.
